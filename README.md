# One Piece Manga Downloader

It is what it is. Just run `main.py` to download One Piece chapter by chapter, page by page.

The chapters are downloaded as folders into the `chapters` root folder. Each chapter folder is named after the chapter number, e.g., the $10^{th}$ chapter's folder is named as `10`. Inside a chapter folder are its pages: `1.jpeg`, `2.jpeg`, and so on.

Use the `Ctrl + C` combination to stop the script whenever you desire.
